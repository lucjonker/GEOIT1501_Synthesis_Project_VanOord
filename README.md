# GEOIT1501_Synthesis_Project_VanOord

This repository contains the implementation for the feature engineering, extraction, and prediction pipeline. 

In FME/Workspaces you will see the processing pipeline that has been derived to extract features from the datasets and write them to a geo-spatial database.
In Python, you will see the code that is used for both statistical analysis of the features, as well as the multi layer perceptron implementation used for sedimentation prediction.
